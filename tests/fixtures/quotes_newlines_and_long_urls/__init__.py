"""
Quotes, newlines, and long URLs: oh, my!

Double quotation marks need to be escaped (by doubling them!) in CSV exports,
    e.g. `Introduce excerpts with "` would become `Introduce excerpts with ""`.

Excel does not tolerate hyperlinks with URLs longer than 255 characters. Not
that we ever explicitly create Excel hyperlinks, but
https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter tries to be helpful and add them
automatically. Excessively long URLs should just be written as strings.
